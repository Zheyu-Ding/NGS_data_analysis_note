# **Ribosome profiling（Ribo-seq）**
## **Introduction to Ribosome Profiling**
Ribosome profiling, also known as Ribo-seq, is a commonly used translational sequencing technique developed to monitor translation in vivo on a genome-wide scale. 
Ribo-seq involves sequencing RNA fragments that are bound to ribosomes during translation, providing accurate information on all translatable molecules in a sample , and enabling precise quantification. It serves as a bridge between the transcriptome and proteome . 
The basic principle of Ribo-seq is the selective isolation and sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, known as ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). RPFs represent the positions of actively translating ribosomes on the transcriptome.
